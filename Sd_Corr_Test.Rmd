```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Try different values for standard deviation and different values for phi

```{r}

sd <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
        17, 18, 19, 20)
sd

phi <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9)

phi

```

Get simulation data based on each of the standard deviation and each of the phi

```{r}

for(val in sd){
  for(val2 in phi){
    ar.sim <- arima.sim(model = list(ar = c(val2)), n = 50000, sd = sqrt(val))
  plot.ts(ar.sim)#plot the simulation data
  acf(ar.sim) #Get ACF
  pacf(ar.sim) # Get PACF
  
  }
}

```
